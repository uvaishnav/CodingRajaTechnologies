# Waste Detection Using YOLO

## Objective 
Waste detection models can be deployed in various locations, such as public spaces, parks, or beaches, to monitor and track waste accumulation. This information can be used to identify areas with high waste generation, enabling targeted cleanup efforts and better waste management planning.

- We will be able to detect 13 different types of wastes  :\
    [banana, chilli, drinkcan, 
    drinkpack, foodcan, lettuce, 
    paper bag, plastic bag, plastic bottle, plastic container,
    sweet potato, tea bag, tissue roll]
